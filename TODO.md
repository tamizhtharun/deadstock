# TODO: Fix Pagination and Security Issues

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add DataTable initialization for #example1 in admin/footer.php with options: paging true, lengthChange false, searching false, ordering true, info true, autoWidth false
- [x] Prevent directory listing by adding "Options -Indexes" to .htaccess
- [x] Fix "View catalogue" link in admin/all-products.php to show "No catalogue" when empty instead of linking to directory

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the pagination on the admin/all-products.php page to ensure it works correctly
- [ ] Verify that custom filters (date and status) still work with pagination
- [ ] Test that directory listing is disabled and catalogue links work properly
